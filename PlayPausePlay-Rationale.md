### Introduction

Mid-career scientists often find themselves at a crossroads. After years of dedication, they may need to pause their research for various reasons—health issues, 
family demands, or simply the desire to explore new paths. This pause, while daunting, is not unusual. In many professions, taking a break is seen as a natural part of a career, 
yet in academia, it can feel like a setback.

Consider Jane, Maarten, Daphne, Pedro, and Rosita.
Each faced unique challenges that led them to step away from their scientific pursuits.
Their stories highlight the need for better support systems for those returning to academia.
Pausing can actually be beneficial; it allows individuals to gain new skills, gain perspective, and even reignite their passion for research.

To facilitate this transition, we need standard procedures for re-establishing affiliation with universities.
Grant opportunities specifically aimed at returners would also help. 
These grants should be agnostic to the reasons for the break, recognizing that everyone’s journey is different.

Existing solutions like the Wellcome Sanger Institute’s Janet Thornton Fellowship and the British Heart Foundation’s Career Re-entry Research Fellowships are steps in the right direction.
They provide funding and support for those looking to re-enter the field after a break.

By fostering continuous dialogue about inclusivity and addressing the unique challenges faced by mid-career scientists,
we can create a more supportive environment that values diverse experiences and backgrounds in science

### Personal Stories

- Jane Luu
- Maarten Roos-Serote
- Daphne Stam
- Pedro Lacerda
- Rosita

### Need for hitting pause

- Poor health
- Family demands (pregnancy, need to care for young, elderly or anyone in need)
- Need to relocate to a place with no jobs
- Wish to try something else

### Pausing is not strange

- **Sabbaticals**: Many academic institutions offer sabbatical leaves, where professors and researchers can take a break to focus on personal projects, research, or rest.
- Other careers do not find pausing a problem
- **Lawyers**: Particularly in large firms, some lawyers may take career breaks, often to pursue further studies (like an LL.M.), travel, or work in public interest law.
- **Chefs and Hospitality Managers**: Some take sabbaticals or breaks between high-pressure jobs to avoid burnout.
- **Tech Entrepreneurs**: Often take breaks between ventures to avoid burnout and gain new perspectives.
- **Humanitarian Workers**: Due to the intense nature of the work, career breaks are often encouraged to prevent burnout.
- **Government Employees**: In some countries, government workers are allowed to take extended leave or career breaks, sometimes referred to as “career breaks” or “unpaid leave.”

### Advantages of hitting pause

- Pausing allows people to do something else
- Potential to add new skills
- Potential to broader range of skills
- Offers perspective
- Helps understand what makes science great
- May reignite passion for research
- academia is a bubble - the outside world is strange

### What would help aspiring returners

- Standard procedure to obtain affiliation status at Universities
- Accreditation based on panel evaluation, ORCiD, etc.
- allows applying for grants
- unpaid is fine - many are willing to do research for "free"
- Grants aimed at returning scientists
- There are lots of different reasons to pause a research
- Should be agnostic for the reason
- They exist for early career and women

### Other ways to return

- science management
- software development
