### Introduction

Mid-career scientists often find themselves at a crossroads. After years of dedication, they may need to pause their research for various reasons—health issues, 
family demands, or simply the desire to explore new paths. This pause, while daunting, is not unusual. In many professions, taking a break is seen as a natural part of a career. 
Yet in academia, it is often considered a setback.
Pausing can actually be beneficial; it allows individuals to gain new skills, gain perspective, and even reignite their passion for research.

This topic needs exposure and discussion: there is a need for better support systems for those wanting to return to research.

To facilitate this transition, we need standard procedures for re-establishing affiliation with universities.
Grant opportunities specifically aimed at returners would be a great help. 
These grants should be agnostic to the reasons for the break, recognizing that everyone’s journey is different.

Existing solutions like the Wellcome Sanger Institute’s Janet Thornton Fellowship and the British Heart Foundation’s Career Re-entry Research Fellowships are steps in the right direction (see below).
They provide funding and support for those looking to re-enter the field after a break.

By fostering continuous dialogue about inclusivity and addressing the unique challenges faced by mid-career scientists,
we can create a more supportive environment that values diverse experiences and backgrounds in science

### Personal Stories

The EPSC splinter session will provide a space to share personal stories.

### Pausing is not strange

- **Sabbaticals**: Many academic institutions offer sabbatical leaves, where professors and researchers can take a break to focus on personal projects, research, or rest;
- Other careers do not find pausing a problem;
- **Lawyers**: Particularly in large firms, some lawyers may take career breaks, often to pursue further studies (like an LL.M.), travel, or work in public interest law;
- **Chefs and Hospitality Managers**: Some take sabbaticals or breaks between high-pressure jobs to avoid burnout;
- **Tech Entrepreneurs**: Often take breaks between ventures to avoid burnout and gain new perspectives;
- **Humanitarian Workers**: Due to the intense nature of the work, career breaks are often encouraged to prevent burnout;
- **Government Employees**: In some countries, government workers are allowed to take extended leave or career breaks, sometimes referred to as “career breaks” or “unpaid leave.”

### Advantages of hitting pause

- Pausing allows people to do something else;
- Potential to broader skill set;
- Offers new perspectives and experiences that will become part of the next steps;
- Helps understand what makes science great, and improves the ability to place science in a larger context;
- May reignite passion for research;
- Explore the world outside the Academia bubble.

### What would help aspiring returners

- Standard procedure to obtain affiliation status at Universities;
- Accreditation based on panel evaluation, ORCiD, etc.;
- Allowing to apply for grants;
- Unpaid could fine and an option, as some would be willing to do research for "free";
- Grants aimed at returning scientists;
- Recoginise the reasons to pause a research and make doing a pause not a taboe;
- Should be agnostic for the reason;
- They do exist for early career and women;

### Other ways to return

- Science management;
- Software development;
- Data analysis;
- Short temporary contracts à la "consultancy";
- Addition to the expenses allowed in publically funded research projects: even though a scientist is in need for a specific consultancy or temporary help, they cannot pay a such a service, instead a far more (administratively) complicated path would need to be taken (contract), which is cumbersome.
